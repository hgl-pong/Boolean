*  Triangle-Triangle Overlap Test Routines
*  July, 2002
*  Updated December 2003
*
*  This file contains C implementation of algorithms for
*  performing two and three-dimensional triangle-triangle intersection test
*  The algorithms and underlying theory are described in
*
* "Fast and Robust Triangle-Triangle Overlap Test
*  Using Orientation Predicates"  P. Guigue - O. Devillers
*
*  Journal of Graphics Tools, 8(1), 2003
*
*  Several geometric predicates are defined.  Their parameters are all
*  points.  Each point is an array of two or three HReal precision
*  HRealing point numbers. The geometric predicates implemented in
*  this file are:
*
*    int tri_tri_overlap_test_3d(p1,q1,r1,p2,q2,r2)
*    int tri_tri_overlap_test_2d(p1,q1,r1,p2,q2,r2)
*
*    int tri_tri_intersection_test_3d(p1,q1,r1,p2,q2,r2,
*                                     coplanar,source,target)
*
*       is a version that computes the segment of intersection when
*       the triangles overlap (and are not coplanar)
*
*    each function returns 1 if the triangles (including their
*    boundary) intersect, otherwise 0
*
*
